# OIBSIP

I have started my 1st internship in the field of Data Science with Oasis Infobyte, where I would be learning through completing different tasks that have been assigned to me during this 1-month journey.

#1) Task one : 
The first task that I was assigned with was to classify the different species of a flower named IRIS: such as setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements.  
I have trained a logistic regression model, a KNN model, as well as a decision tree model, where I have found the accuracy to be almost 100 percent.  
I also used hot-encoding to convert the target values into numeric data type from string values so that it would be easy for my machine learning model to learn and predict from.
