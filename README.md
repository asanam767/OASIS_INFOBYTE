# OIBSIP

I have started my 1st internship in the field of Data Science with Oasis Infobyte, where I will be learning through completing different tasks assigned to me during this 1-month journey.

## 1) Task One

The first task assigned to me was to classify different species of a flower named IRIS, such as Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, which differ according to their measurements.  
I trained a Logistic Regression model, a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, and a Decision Tree model, achieving an accuracy of almost 100 percent.  
I also used one-hot encoding to convert target values from string to numeric data types, making it easier for my machine learning models to learn and predict.

## 2) Task Two

The second task was to analyze the unemployment rate in India.  
I used various libraries to perform this analysis.

## 3) Task Three

For the third task, I was assigned to predict the selling price of cars based on various feature sets.  
I used a Random Forest Regressor model to make these predictions and evaluated the model using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation criterion.  
Additionally, I employed one-hot encoding to convert string data types to numerical data types for better model performance.

## 4) Task Four

The fourth task involved identifying whether an email is spam or ham.  
I used a Logistic Regression model for this classification task. To transform the text data into numerical data, I used the TfidfVectorizer library, which helped the machine better understand and predict the content of the emails.

## 5) Task Five

For the fifth task, I was required to predict how much of a product people will buy based on different features given in the dataset.  
I used the XGBoost model for this purpose and evaluated the model's performance using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation criterion.
