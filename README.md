# OIBSIP
I have started my 1st internship in the field of Data Science with Oasis Infobyte , where i would be learning through completing different tasks that have been assigned to me during this 1 month journey.
 1)Task one : The first task that i was assigned with was to classify the different species of a flower named IRIS : such as setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements.
 I have trained a logistic regression model , a KNN model , as well as  decision tree model , where i have found the accuracy to be almost 100 percent.
 I also used hot-encoding to convert the target values into numeric data type from string values so that it would be easy for my machine learning model to learn and predict from.
